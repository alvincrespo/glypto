# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Glypto is a TypeScript CLI tool project. The project is in early development with a basic "Hello World" CLI structure.

## Development Commands

- `npm run build` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run watch` - Compile TypeScript in watch mode
- `npm run dev` - Run the CLI directly from source using tsx
- `npm start` - Run the compiled CLI from `dist/index.js`
- `npm run lint` - Lint TypeScript files in src/ using ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format TypeScript files using Prettier

Note: No test framework is currently configured (test script returns error).

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts` - Main CLI entry point (currently just logs "Hello from glypto CLI!")
- `bin/glypto` - Executable CLI script that requires the compiled dist/index.js
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated by `npm run build`)
- TypeScript configured with Node 24 base config, targeting dist/ output

## Architecture

This is a simple CLI tool built with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Commander.js for CLI argument parsing (dependency available)
- Chalk for terminal colors (dependency available)
- ESLint with TypeScript rules for code quality
- Prettier for code formatting

The CLI is designed to be installed globally and run as `glypto` command.

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses modern ESLint flat config with TypeScript support:
- Enforces no unused variables as errors
- Warns on explicit any usage
- Follows recommended JS and TypeScript rules
